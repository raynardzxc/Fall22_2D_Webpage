===

This README contains instructions to set up the webpage done as part of the BONUS section of Task 3 in the 2D project.

# Installation

This webpage was built on fully on React for both the front-end and back-end. 

The top-level directory will be referred to as `$TOP`.

## React Set-up

To run the webpage locally, you will need to install the React dependencies. Change current directory into the `ui` folder.

`cd $TOP/ui`

Install all dependencies.

`npm install`

Run the app locally.

`npm start`

At the end of this step, the React webpage should be up and running.

# Using the Webpage

Enter/select your desired input variables and press the `Predict` button. 

You should see the model's predicted value if done correctly.

We did not have time to do input validation so please do not enter anything other than numerical values into the inputs.
