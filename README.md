01.020 Design Thinking Project III (Task 3)
===

This README contains instructions to set up the webpage done as part of the BONUS section of Task 3 in the 2D project. 

This webpage was built fully on React for both the front-end and back-end. 

This webpage is meant to serve as a tool to help predict the yield of rice in kg/ha based on a country's sustainability inputs. The back-end is a Multiple Linear Regression model that was trained in Python.

You can either run the webpage locally or view it online through the following URL: 
[https://fall22-2-d-webpage.vercel.app/](https://fall22-2-d-webpage.vercel.app/)


# Installation

To run the webpage locally, refer to the following instructions.

Clone this repo:

`git clone https://github.com/raynardzxc/Fall22_2D_Webpage.git`

`cd Fall22_2D_Webpage/ui`

Install the dependencies:

`npm install`

Run the app locally:

`npm start`

At the end of this step, the React webpage should be up and running.


# Using the Webpage

Enter/select your desired input variables and press the `Predict` button. 

You should see the model's predicted value if done correctly.

As we did not have time to do input validation, please do not enter anything other than numerical values into the inputs.
